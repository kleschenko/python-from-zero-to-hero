Python From Zero To Hero
=========================

This is an example of Python application which allows to search twits in Twitter and display a tweets as long as a link to the Google Maps in case if tweet contains geodata.


Steps
-----
- [x] step_0 Project structure and base requirements.
- [x] step_1 Simple Hello World! application on Flask. 
- [x] step_2 Configuration.
- [x] step_3 Tests.
- [x] step_4 Static files and Jinja2 templates (+some Twitter Bootstrap).
- [ ] step_5 DB (MySQL + SQLAlchemy).

- [ ] step_8 More backend (Show a list of tweets as long as a link to Google Maps for tweets which has Geo data.
- [ ] step_9 More backend (do NLP stuff with tweets).

*NOTE*: steps 7-9 can be implemented as a part of Flask app or as a separate
processes/threads (we can use Celery).

Each sep is tegged wiht ``step_n`` tag where `n` is a number of step.

How to start
------------

2. Clone this repository.
3. Switch to the required step (``git checkout <tag_name>``)
4. Insall dependencies (``pip install -U -r requirements.txt``)
5. Do something.

-----------
1. Create user:
   ``CREATE USER 'twitter_explorer'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';``
2. Grant privileges:
   ```mysql
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on twitter_explorer.* to 'twitter_explorer'@'localhost';``
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on twitter_explorer.* to 'twitter_explorer_test'@'localhost'
   ```
3. Create DBs:
