Python From Zero To Hero
=========================

This is an example of Python application which allows to search twits in Twitter and display a tweets as long as a link to the Google Maps in case if tweet contains geodata.


Steps
-----
0. Project structure and base requirements.
1. Simple Hello World! application on Flask. 
2. Configuration.
3. Tests.
4. Static files and Jinja2 templates (+some Twitter Bootstrap). *In Progress*
6. DB (MySQL + SQLAlchemy) *TBD*
5. Login and sessions *TBD*
6. Backend (tweepy module to search for tweets by some criteria).
7. More backend (Show a list of tweets as long as a link to Google Maps for
   tweets which has Geo data). *TBD*
8. More backend (do NLP stuff with tweets). *TBD*

*NOTE*: steps 6-8 can be implemented as a part of Flask app or as a separate
processes/threads (we can use Celery).
